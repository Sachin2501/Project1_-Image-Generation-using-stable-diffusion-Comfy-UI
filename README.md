# Project: Image Generation Using Stable Diffusion & ComfyUI

This project leverages Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art AI model, for generating high-quality images from text prompts. Using ComfyUI, a powerful and modular node-based interface, we design customizable workflows for fine-tuned image synthesis. The project explores text-to-image generation, inpainting, and style customization, enabling creative and professional-grade AI-generated visuals. Ideal for artists, developers, and AI enthusiasts, this setup enhances flexibility and control over the image generation process. ðŸš€ðŸŽ¨
